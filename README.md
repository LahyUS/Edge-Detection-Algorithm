# Edge Detection Algorithm

Edge Detection Algorithm is a project implemented in C++ using OpenCV. It aims to implement various edge detection algorithms from scratch, including Sobel, Prewitt, Laplace, and Canny, for study purposes in the field of image processing.

## Features

- Implementation of Sobel, Prewitt, Laplace, and Canny edge detection algorithms
- Study and analysis of different edge detection techniques
- Utilizes OpenCV library for image processing operations
